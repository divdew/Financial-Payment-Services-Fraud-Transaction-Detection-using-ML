# 🚨 Fraud Transaction Detection

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to detect fraudulent financial transactions using a real-world inspired dataset (~6.3M rows, 10+ features). Fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones, making this a **highly imbalanced classification problem**.  

The goal is to proactively identify fraud patterns, improve detection rates, and suggest infrastructure-level prevention strategies for financial institutions.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Size:** 6,362,620 rows × 10 columns  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `step`: Time step (hours)  
  - `type`: Transaction type (CASH_OUT, TRANSFER, PAYMENT, etc.)  
  - `amount`: Transaction amount  
  - `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`: Sender’s balances before and after  
  - `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`: Receiver’s balances before and after  
  - `isFraud`: Fraud label (target variable)  
  - `isFlaggedFraud`: Flag raised by existing system

## ⚙️ Methodology  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled **missing values, infinite values, and zero balances** with safe replacements.  
- Removed redundant raw balance columns by engineering more meaningful features.  
- Addressed **class imbalance** using `class_weight='balanced'` during model training.  

### 2. Feature Engineering  
- **Time Features:** `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week` (derived from `step`)  
- **Balance Discrepancies:** `errorBalanceOrig`, `errorBalanceDest`  
- **Proportional Ratios:** `amount_to_oldbalance_ratio`, `balance_change_ratio_orig`, `balance_change_ratio_dest`  
- **Categorical Encoding:** Transaction `type` (TRANSFER, CASH_OUT critical for fraud)  

### 3. Model Development  
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (`n_estimators=100`, `class_weight='balanced'`)  
- **Train/Test Split:** Stratified 80/20 split  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - ROC-AUC   
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score   

---

## 📊 Results  
- **ROC-AUC:** ~0.98  
- Fraud concentrated in **TRANSFER** and **CASH_OUT** transaction types  
- Engineered features (balance discrepancies, ratios) were top predictors, confirming domain intuition  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- Fraudulent transactions often leave **inconsistencies in balance updates**  
- Fraudsters tend to **drain accounts completely**, reflected in high ratio features  
- Most fraud flows through **TRANSFER → CASH_OUT**, consistent with money laundering patterns  
- Temporal features add moderate but useful signal (fraud spikes at odd hours)  

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations  
- Implement **real-time fraud detection** with hybrid ML + rules  
- Introduce **velocity checks and step-up authentication** for high-risk transactions  
- Monitor **model drift** and retrain regularly to adapt to evolving fraud strategies  
- Use **canary rollouts and A/B testing** to evaluate new prevention measures before full deployment
